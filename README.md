# Student-App
Description: The aim for building this app is to create a platform where people with common interests can connect and set up their communities.This app would allow people to explore communities with common interests and help them to socialise among themselves.
We are planning to create a chatting arena for the people, with some basic interests, like music, dance, etc., and help them set up their own communities, over which they can interact with each other.
Team members: Parina Jain, Ritika Chandwani, Dhawal Nagardhankar, Mrunal Raskar.
