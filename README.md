# Student-App
Description: The aim for building this app is to create a platform where people with common interests can connect and set up their communities.This app would allow people to explore communities with common interests and help then to socialise among themselves.
We are planning to create a chatting arena for the people, with some basic communities, like music, dance, etc., and set up their own, over which they can interact with each other.
Team members: Parina Jain, Ritika Chandwani, Dhawal Nagardhankar, Mrunal Raskar.
